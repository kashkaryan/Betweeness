For our NETS project, we focused mostly on social networks. In class we learned about metrics to 
measure the strength of a social network in the context of strong relationships different people
have with one another. Two of these are neighborhood overlap and the strong triadic closure 
property. The former is the ratio of neighbors two nodes have in common, while the latter
deconstructs the power of a strong bond and its ability to create triadic friendships. In our
project, we wanted to test the value of the edge with the highest betweeness, and its influence on 
these two metrics. Therefore, we implemented the Girvan-Newman algorithm to calculate the betweeness
of every edge and remove the highest betweenesss while comparing the average neighborhood overlap 
and the number of nodes who violate the triadic closure principle before and after. We repeated 
the experiment on a small data set on tribe relationships in a small portion of New Guinea 
and on a larger data set of a network of email conversations between professors at the school of 
the University of Irvine, California. Between the data sets, we paid close attention to the
difference in volatility of the metrics. 

We stuck to the category of social networks for the assignment a well as graph algorithms as we 
needed to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find all the shortest paths that go through an edge.
Our deliverables are that for an empirical analysis, with data to back up our hypothesis in our 
write up.

In terms of how we divided the work, Kachik was in charge of implementing the graph data structure,
importing the data, and implementing the Girvan-Newman algorithm using Dijkstra's. Jenny was in
charge of finding reasonable data to import, and measuring the neighborhood overlap, and triadic 
closure. Finally, together we recorded the data we wanted, created a summary report, and 
analyzed the data we found in terms of a hypothesis.
